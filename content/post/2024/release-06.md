The June release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. There are no notable user-facing changes in this version, as our dev team has been mostly busy with a revamp of our CI infrastructure.

In other YosysHQ news:

* Prof. Andrew Kahng's keynote at the [EFCL summer school](https://efcl.ethz.ch/efcl-summer-school.html) was on accelerating innovation with open source tools. Of particular interest was using the results from open source tools as a proxy for the proprietary tools.
