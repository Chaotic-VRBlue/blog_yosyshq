The January release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* You can now pass arguments to tcl scripts from the command line by appending them at the end of the command, separated from the yosys arguments by "--".

    yosys -c script.tcl -- arg1 arg2

In other YosysHQ news:

* We published a new [community spotlight by Frans Skarman](/p/community-spotlight-surfer/). Introducing us to Surfer, which is a new web-based waveform viewer with a focus on extensibility and a snappy user interface.
* We are hiring! If you know anyone currently looking for a job developing EDA tools, let them know about our [jobs page](https://www.yosyshq.com/jobs).

Happy New Year,
The YosysHQ Team
