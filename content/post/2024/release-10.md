The October release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* Fixed an issue in SBY that could lead to the wrong hierarchical path being printed for an assertion failure if multiple instances of the same module exist in the design.
* Builds for [Macs with Apple silicon](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IA4oTVJOsj1V2-Jp4qask-_ZUcBDcmZU?usp=drive_link) will now be included in the releases.

In other YosysHQ news:

* Our team will be gathering for our first in-person get-together in Vienna next week. Please excuse any delayed response times as folks zip across the globe!

Happy October,

The YosysHQ Team
