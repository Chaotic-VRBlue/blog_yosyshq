The September release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* Tabby CAD Suite now optionally supports floating licenses via FlexLM. Floating licenses are priced at 600â‚¬/month (double the price of node-locked licenses). Existing customers may exchange two node-locked licenses for one floating license - please contact us if this would be of interest to you.

In other YosysHQ news:

* YosysHQ's Matt Venn will be at [ORConf 2023](https://orconf.org/) in Munich next week (September 15th to 17th). If you are also attending, come say hi!

Happy September,
The YosysHQ Team
