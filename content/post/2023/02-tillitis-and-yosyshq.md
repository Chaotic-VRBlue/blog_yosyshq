We are happy to announce that we are working with [Tillitis](https://tillitis.se/) on their next generation of USB security key.

Their current model TKeyâ„¢ is [open source hardware and software](https://github.com/tillitis). It uses a Lattice iCE40, chosen due to it being supported by our open source FPGA tools.

The new version includes an upgraded FPGA with more security features. YosysHQ will be working to add support for this FPGA to NextPNR.  

The best news is that the work will be open sourced so you will soon have a new family of FPGAs to experiment with!
