The June release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* The RISC-V Formal Verification Toolbox has gained a bus interface for checking that instructions relating to memory result in matching bus transactions, as well as some checks for the machine-mode CSRs required by the RISC-V privileged specification.

In other YosysHQ news:

* You might have seen Bruno Levy’s excellent introduction to RISCV on an FPGA. In our most [recent blog post](/p/blinker-to-risc-v/), guest author Bastian Löher shows how he followed the tutorial using Amaranth instead of Verilog.
* Nina & Matt will be attending the Free Silicon Conference in July.
* Matt will be attending the RISCV summit hardware track this Friday 9th June.

Happy June,
The YosysHQ Team
