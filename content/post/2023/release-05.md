The May release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* The synthprop pass was added, which converts SVA assert properties into module outputs that flag assertion violations. See help synthprop for details!

In other YosysHQ news:

* We just published the 3rd in our series of ‘community spotlight’ blog posts. This time we’re featuring [AutoSVA by Marcelo Vera](/p/community-spotlight-autosva/) which aims to make Formal Property Verification more accessible to hardware designers.

Happy May,
The YosysHQ Team
