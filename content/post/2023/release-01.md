Tabby CAD Suite version 20230104 released!

The January release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. With the holidays there have been only a few changes, of note:

* SBY output is now in color.

# In other YosysHQ news:

* We have reformatted our service table to clarify some points we've seen cause confusion. Don't worry, our prices remain the same as they've always been!
* Our first [community spotlight article is about Tbengy](/p/community-spotlight-tbengy/), which is a Python Tool for SV/UVM Testbench Generation and RTL Synthesis.

Happy New Year!
The YosysHQ Team
