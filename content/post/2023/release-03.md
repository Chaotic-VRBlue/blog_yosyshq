Tabby CAD Suite version 20230306 released!

The March release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* There is now support for tying licenses to Google Cloud Instance ID and to GitLab groups or repositories. 

In other YosysHQ news:

* We have a [new community spotlight article about sv2v](https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/community-spotlight-sv2v/). sv2v converts SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800-2017) to Verilog (IEEE 1364-2005), with an emphasis on supporting synthesizable language constructs.
* Our GitHub action that [installs the oss-cad-suite has had an update](https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/oss-cad-suite-github-action-update/).

Happy March,
The YosysHQ Team
