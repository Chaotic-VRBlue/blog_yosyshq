Tabby CAD Suite version 20230414 released!

The April release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* The initial release of our new equivalence checking tool EQY is now available. Try out some of the [examples](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/eqy/en/latest/quickstart.html)!

In other YosysHQ news:

* We have started a new series called ‘[Yosys One Liners](https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/yosys-one-liners-axi/)’ where we share some useful one liners. The first one shows how to show there are no combinatorial paths between input and output signals - useful for verifying correct AXI behaviour.

Happy April,
The YosysHQ Team
