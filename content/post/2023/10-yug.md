We have recently started a Yosys User's Group. You can see the [minutes of our first 2 calls here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e8hERQ_eqLQrdtH1WXnGUXDtgyQ8oa_zZWXPHJCiN0/edit#heading=h.dqkvsnhcju2v).

So far we've talked about:

* What people are using Yosys for,
* How things can be improved,
* Introducing our new tools,
* A [demo of our new formal equivalence tool - eqy](https://github.com/YosysHQ/eqy).

If you'd like to join, then please [sign up to the newsletter](/newsletter) or follow us on:

* [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@yosyshq) or
