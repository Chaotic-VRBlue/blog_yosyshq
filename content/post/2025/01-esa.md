In what was a major achievement in open source FPGA development, [we have now added support for the largest FPGA](https://nebula.esa.int/4000141380) so far supported by open source tooling! 500,000 LUTs!

In November 2024 we successfully concluded the European Space Agency funded [project](https://activities.esa.int/4000141380) in collaboration with [NanoXplore](https://nanoxplore.com/), known for their space rated FPGAs.

The tool provides developers with a flexible and customizable option for designing for NG-Ultra FPGAs, offering increased reliability through the ability to cross-verify designs using two independent tools.

Future work could focus on expanding support within nextpnr to cover additional FPGA primitives, such as high-speed I/O blocks and SoC integration making it more useful for high complexity designs.
