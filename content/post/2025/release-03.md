The March release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* We've added a new command `abstract` that can be used to replace concrete signal values with unconstrained abstract values during formal verification. See the [documentation](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/abstract.html) for more details.

In other YosysHQ news:

* In our most recent Yosys User’s Group, Emil presented “ASIC synthesis with Yosys”. He covered ASIC synthesis, Yosys scripts, abc scripts and new Yosys features for ASIC. The talk was recorded and you can watch it here: https://youtu.be/PlS4e5S5bCA

Happy March,
The YosysHQ Team
