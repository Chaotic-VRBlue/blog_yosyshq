This Application Note was written with the intention of showing a brief introduction to SVA, and is definitely not a substitute for extensive training. To learn more about formal verification and SVA, it is recommended to book the course given by the FPV specialists at YosysHQ.

* A brief history of SystemVerilog Assertions
* SVA layers definition and examples
* Assertion types, sequential property operators
* A short description of liveness and safety properties
* Practical examples using the sequence builder module written by our CTO Claire Xen.
