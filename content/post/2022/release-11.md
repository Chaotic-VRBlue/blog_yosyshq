The November release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

We have experimentally added support for EDIF and Liberty verific parsers. They can be used either with the verific [-liberty|-edif] or the read [-liberty|-edif] command. We are evaluating whether it is of interest for us to keep these long-term, so please let us know if you use them and what your experience is!
