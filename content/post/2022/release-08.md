The August release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.

## SBY

* SBY now uses a more precise logic loop analysis, removing the need to run simplemap on coarse-grain cells that re-use parts of a signal.

## In other YosysHQ news

* Since we introduced the new autotune option, weâ€™ve now written up a [blogpost](https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/sby-autotune/) with an example on how to get started.
