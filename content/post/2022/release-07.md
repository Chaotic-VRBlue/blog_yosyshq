The July release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download.

## SBY

* An autotune function! This won’t fix your singing, but we hope it will help you to choose a good solver for your application. Please check the [new documentation](https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autotune.html) here to get started. Please let us know if you try the new feature. We will write a blogpost about it for the next newsletter.

## In other YosysHQ news

* Since tribuf support was added in May, we wrote a [short blogpost](https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/formal-trisate-support/) about Matt’s use of it for his latest ASIC submission. We also added an example to the [sby examples](https://github.com/YosysHQ/sby/tree/master/docs/examples/tristate).
