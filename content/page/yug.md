The Yosys User's Group is for anyone who uses Yosys. We present recent updates to the tools, showcase new features and invite our users to present their work.

You can see the [minutes of our calls here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e8hERQ_eqLQrdtH1WXnGUXDtgyQ8oa_zZWXPHJCiN0/edit#heading=h.dqkvsnhcju2v).

## YUG 8 - Using formal to detect information leakage

After a long summer break, our meetings have resumed again! Our last meeting on October 29th had [Katharina CeesaySeitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharina-ceesay-seitz-ba521087) from ETH Zürich present her work on using special netlist transformations in a custom Yosys pass in combination with formal verification to detect microarchitectural information leakage via hardware timing side channels. Watch her talk on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxp-5kNMt40).
